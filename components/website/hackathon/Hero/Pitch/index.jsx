          It will start at the end of the 18th of February and will run until
          the end of the afternoon of the 20th. There are more than 40 hours to
          have fun programming! And, if you need to, you can always count on the
          help of our mentors. Each team may have between 3 and 5 elements. If
          you are unable to complete a team, you can always register
          individually or in pairs, and we will try to group you with other
          participants.
